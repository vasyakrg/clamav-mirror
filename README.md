# ClamAV-Mirror

This is a Docker Image for a lightweight containerized ClamAV Mirror using [CVD-Update](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/cvdupdate) and [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy). This image uses Alpine to minimize the image size and unnecessary bloat.

## Dependencies

- Docker

docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag clamav-mirror:latest
```

## ClamAV Configuration

Once you have the mirror running, you can visit <http://localhost:8080> to see what files are hosted by this server. You can then point any of your ClamAV instances to use this mirror instead by changing the following in your `freshclam.conf` file:

```txt
DatabaseMirror http://localhost:8080
```
